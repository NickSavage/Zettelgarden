Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ 

Thanks everyone for your interest in Zettelgarden! ðŸŒ± My most recent blog post on Substack (https://nsavage.substack.com/p/beyond-rag-building-a-knowledge-management?r=rj3uw) made the front page of Hacker News and I have been shocked by the response. 

This mailing list will be specific to Zettelgarden project updates, while my Substack will be more general. This mailing list will be relatively quiet, but I will send at most a few, focused emails per month. 

Zettelgarden is an open source project and will be able to be selfhosted, but as you can see at https://zettelgarden.com, I am hosting it. It's currently free for all, but I suspect that cannot last forever. Some of the LLM features I want to add will be expensive to operate. What I can promise though is that Zettelgarden will never have ads and that it will stay open source. 

On the roadmap for the next few weeks, I am going to work on improving documentation and discoverability. I was surprised by the reaction on Hacker News, and I don't think Zettelgarden was really ready for users. It had Lorem Ipsum on the main page! I'm going to be getting it ready for people to selfhost themselves and start using, but also start making features more discoverable. Just today I made it clear that tasks can be made to be recurring.
