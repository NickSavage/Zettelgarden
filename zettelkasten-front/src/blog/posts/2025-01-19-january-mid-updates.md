Hi everyone! 👋

We've been busy growing Zettelgarden with some exciting new features and improvements! Here's a bit of what's new in the last two weeks.

## New Demo Channel 📺
We've launched our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@zettelgarden) where you can find demonstrations of Zettelgarden features. Have a specific feature you'd like to see explained? Let us know, and we'll add it to our demo queue!

We've also launched our official X (Twitter) account, [@Zettelgarden](https://x.com/zettelgarden). Follow us for the latest updates, tips, and community highlights!

## Interface & Task Management Improvements 💅
We've been focusing on making Zettelgarden more intuitive and user-friendly. Recent updates include:

- A completely redesigned task interface, bringing important features out of the hamburger menu
- New card and task history tracking to monitor changes over time
- Improved navigation and accessibility across the entire app
- Better visual organization and responsiveness

## Smarter Search with Cohere 🔍
We've upgraded our search capabilities using [Cohere's](https://cohere.com/) reranking technology. This means:

- Faster search results
