# Welcome to Zettelgarden! 🌱

Welcome to your knowledge garden! Zettelgarden is an open-source personal knowledge management system
that preserves human insight while leveraging modern technology. Built on zettelkasten principles,
it helps you develop and maintain your own understanding of the world.

## 🤖 AI-Powered Analysis & Summarization

While other tools rush to automate everything with LLMs, Zettelgarden
takes a measured approach. AI features are designed to augment your
thinking process, not replace it. Our summarization pipeline delivers both
high-level insights through executive summaries and detailed evidence-driven
reference summaries with theses, arguments, and facts — helping you see the big
picture without losing important nuance.

Transform dense articles, podcasts, or research into clear two-part outputs:

- **Executive Summaries:** Concise, strategic, and outcome-focused summaries for decision-makers.
- **Reference Summaries:** Detailed, factual, and precise summaries with ranked arguments and verifiable facts for researchers.

## 🔬 Facts & Entities - Granular Insights

Go beyond high-level summaries and explore the building blocks of knowledge:

- **Entities:** Automatically identify and extract key concepts, people, places, and organizations from your notes to reveal hidden connections.
- **Facts:** Automatically pull out discrete, verifiable statements (like statistics, events, or claims of evidence) from your source material, allowing you to build arguments on a solid foundation.

## 📝 Cards - Your Knowledge Building Blocks

Cards are the fundamental building blocks of your knowledge garden. Each card represents a single idea, concept, or piece of information.
You can:
- Create new cards for any type of content
- Link cards together to create knowledge networks
- Create hierarchical relationships between cards
- Use markdown formatting for rich content
