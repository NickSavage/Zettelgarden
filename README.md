# Zettelgarden

A human-centric, open-source personal knowledge management system that preserves human insight while leveraging modern technology. Built on zettelkasten principles, it helps you develop and maintain your own understanding of the world.

**NOTE: This project is actively evolving. While stable for personal use, features may change based on community feedback and development priorities.**

## Core Principles

- **Human-Centric Knowledge Organization**: Create and connect atomic notes that reflect your understanding, not just store information.
- **Thoughtful AI Integration**: AI features augment your thinking process without replacing human insight.
- **Built for Scale**: Designed to grow from personal notes to company knowledge bases while maintaining clarity.

## Features

- **Capture Information**: Store diverse content types including:
  - Cards (atomic pieces of information)
  - Tasks (with recurring capability)
  - Files (PDF, images, etc.)
  
- **Connect Information**: Create meaningful links between your content, forming an interconnected web of knowledge that preserves context and insight.

- **Smart Retrieval**: Utilizing advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and entity processing to:
  - Efficiently locate information
  - Suggest meaningful connections
  - Pre-chunk information for optimal retrieval

## Why Zettelgarden?

Zettelgarden takes a measured approach to knowledge management, focusing on:

1. **Atomic Notes**: Small, discrete pieces of information that are easy to link and maintain
2. **Personal Curation**: Emphasis on reading and writing your own thoughts rather than just collecting information
3. **Pre-chunked Information**: Optimized for both human understanding and AI-assisted retrieval

## Architecture

Built with transparency and efficiency in mind:

- `zettelkasten-front`: Frontend using React and TypeScript
- `go-backend`: Backend using Go with `net/http`
- `python-mail`: SMTP service in Python
